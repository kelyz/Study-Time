# Study-Time

## About
This is a multithreaded Java Swing alarm clock and timer that directs users to a web link of their choice when the alarm rings. It can be a helpful tool for studying, especially when linked with Quizlet flashcards (which was the original inspiration for the project!). Of course, you can always link it to YouTube at your discretion.
